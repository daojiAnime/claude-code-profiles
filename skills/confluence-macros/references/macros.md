## What are macros?

**Contents:**
- What are macros?
- Add a macro to your page or live doc
  - Macro parameters
  - Macro placeholders
- Conflicts between two macros
- Macros available in the editor
- Macros from the Marketplace
- Blocked macros
  - What happens to app data associated with a macro that is blocked?
  - What if I don’t want my users to see the ‘blocked app’ error on the page?

Using macros helps you to extend the capabilities of your Confluence pages and live docs, allowing you to add extra functionality or include dynamic content. For example, use the Attachments macro to list files attached to content, or use the Widget Connector macro to include things like a YouTube video or Twitter feed.

When editing, select from the toolbar

Find the macro by name and select it

Configure it as needed

You can also type / on the page to bring up the same list you'd see by selecting from the toolbar. Continue typing the name of the macro to filter the list.

Select the macro placeholder.

Select the Edit icon to open the configuration panel.

Configure the parameters. Your changes are saved as you go.

Resume editing the page, and the panel closes.

You can also select the centered , medium-width , and full-width icons to adjust the width of some macros. Select the trashcan iconto remove the macro.

Many macros have optional parameters you can use to control the macro's output.

With the Attachments Macro, for instance, you have two optional parameters allowing you to:

Specify the file formats of the attachments displayed

Choose whether or not you want old versions of the attachments displayed

Macro placeholders are displayed in the editor where you have added a macro to a page or doc.

When editing, you can:

Double-click a macro placeholder (or click the placeholder and choose Edit) to open the macro dialog window and edit the macro's parameters

Select a macro placeholder to cut, copy and paste the macro

Some Marketplace macros, or apps, can’t be installed together because they were given the same internal ID. When you try to install an app with a name that conflicts with a previously installed macro, you will see this error message:

Unable to install <app B>Your instance has <app A> from the same partner that does not allow installation of ‘App B’ due to technical constraints.

The quickest solution is to uninstall one app so that you can install the other.

You may also want to contact the developer through the Atlassian Marketplace and ask them to address the error.

Below is a list of the macros available in the editor.

Select a macro name for details of the usage, including optional parameters and examples.

Many more macros are available from the Atlassian Marketplace.

When you navigate to a page or live doc in Confluence, some macros may appear with a message informing you that an administrator has blocked this app:

When using macros that leverage apps from the Atlassian Marketplace, it is possible for your organization admin to block an app’s access to your data through a data security policy with an app access rule. When this rule is applied, you can no longer use macros that were provided by apps that have been blocked in the coverage selected by your organization.

Contact your Confluence admin to discuss available options.

Data that is stored by a blocked macro is subject to the retention policy of the partner who developed the macro. After the retention period, this data may be deleted and may not be able to be restored. Therefore, if you notice missing data, discuss it with your Confluence admin so that any required steps can be taken to preserve the data.

As a workaround, you can remove the app blocked message from the content by removing the macro from the page or live doc. This will also delete any data on it that the app has stored within the macro, but will not remove data the macro may have stored in app storage that is subject to the partner’s retention policy, as above.

The Atlassian Community is here for you.

Macros are how you supercharge your Confluence pages.

You can use macros to:

Take your Confluence space to the next level using macros.

Screenshot: Page containing Status, Page Properties Report, Livesearch, and Profile Picture macros to help people find information about particular projects.

To add a macro to your page:

In the editor you'll see a placeholder that represents the macro. Once you publish your page, you'll see the macro in its full glory.

Macro parameters are used to change the behavior of a macro.

To change the macro parameters:

Head to the documentation for specific macros below for full details of the parameters available in each macro.

Here's a list of macros currently available with Confluence Data Center.

Click a macro name for details of the usage, including optional parameters and examples.

This documentation provides information on all the macros that are provided with Confluence by default. There may be other macros in your site, from Marketplace Apps, or perhaps developed in-house.

You can find a wide range of Atlassian and third party macros at The Marketplace. These are distributed as apps and can be installed by a Confluence Administrator.

Users with System Administrator permissions can create user macros - see Writing User Macros.

If you want to create something more complex, you can develop your own plugin - see Writing Confluence Plugins.

Confluence administrators can check how often each macro is used in your site.

Macro usage reporting helps you make informed decisions about your macros. You can view which macros are used most often, grouped by app, and easily distinguish between Atlassian and third-party macros. You’ll also find direct links to manage third-party apps in the Universal Plugin Manager (UPM).

You can identify underused apps, plan for cloud migration, and troubleshoot performance issues without running manual database queries or raising support tickets to understand macro and app usage across your site.

To see how often a macro is used:

In view page mode, disabled macros show a placeholder image:

When macros with body content are disabled, the content will be preserved and display in the editor.

To display the content in view mode:

In the editor, the disabled macro will switch to the new macro and display your content. Update the page to display the content in view mode.
